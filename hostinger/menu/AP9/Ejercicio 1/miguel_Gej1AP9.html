            <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
            <p>
                Thank you for your recent <strong><em>application to join us</em></strong> at the University of
                Awesome's
                science faculty to study
                as
                part of
                your PhD next year.
                I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
            </p>
            <h2>Starting dates</h2>
            <p>
                We are happy to accomodate you <strong><em>starting</em></strong> your study with us at any time,
                however it
                would suit us better if
                you could start at the beginning of a semester;
                the start dates for each one are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>First semester: <time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time></li>
                <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
                <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-05-02">02 May 2017</time></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
            <p>You can find more information about important university dates on <a target="_blank"

            <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
            <p>
                At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility â€” as long as the subjects
                fall
                somewhere in the realm of science and technology.
                You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our
                team.
                Saying that,
                of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
                    (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
                <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30&deg;C
                    (86&deg;F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 &times; 10<sup>3</sup> &gt;
                    3 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
                <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr
                        title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
                    constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the
                research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know?
                Thanks.
            </p>

            <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt><em>Polynesian chicken dance</em></dt>
                <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance
                    around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".</dd>
                <dt><em>Icelandic brownian shuffle</em></dt>
                <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance,
                    which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around
                    in imperceptably tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought
                    this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
                <dt><em>Arctic robot dance</em></dt>
                <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
                    discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by
                    inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just
                    moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>
